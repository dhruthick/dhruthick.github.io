      <li>
        At IUDX, I was part of the Analytics team where my most prominent contribution was 
        a novel road network construction algorithm. The algorithm utilized public bus transit data from across the city
        and Uber's open-source H3 framework to build road segments. The network was then used to build and deploy a 
        state-of-the-art Temporal Graph Convolutional Network trained on the transit data to model city-wide 
        road traffic in real-time.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also analyzed large-scale geospatial smart city data from domains such as transit management, air quality, 
        and emergency services to draw pertinent insights using efficient visualization techniques, as part of 
        government-funded research.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some of my other tasks also involved machine learning (regression, boosting, clustering, etc.) and deep learning algorithms 
        (CNNs, LSTMs etc.), mathematical and statistical approaches to solve problems such as vehicle traffic vs. 
        air quality correlation analysis, traffic modeling, and name-entity recognition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our team collaboratively implemented a dashboard showcasing the above and illustrating the possibilities of effectively 
        utilizing smart city data between city departments to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

      <li>
        As a research intern I got hands my dirty in several ways. I refactored a custom Python software development 
        kit to add a functionality that can be used to 
        fetch both historical and real-time smart city data into Pandas data frames, with improved efficiency and 
        authorization for company-wide usage.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also studied the correlation between air quality sensors across the city, and performed geospatial 
        interpolation of readings to visualize metrics over the entire city effectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        One of my final tasks was developing a multi-class classification model using 
        recurrent neural networks that classify grievances 
        submitted by citizens to the city municipality in Gujarati through an online portal, by translating them to English first. 
        This showcased the possibilitiy of accelerating the processing time of posted grievances by utilizing data that was already available.
